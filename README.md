# CRM-and-Sales-Pipeline
PowerBI Dashboard
A company aims to evaluate its CRM data and sales pipeline for leads registered over the last five months. The task is to build a comprehensive analytical report that provides insights into lead distribution across countries, industries, and organization sizes. The report will assess the health of the sales pipeline, forecast potential income over the next few months, and compare sales agent performance.


CRM & Sales Pipeline Data Analysis is designed to provide deep insights into sales pipeline and lead distribution. Itâ€™s built to help business users make data-driven decisions by enabling them to drill down and filter data intuitively.
